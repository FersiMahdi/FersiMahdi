âš¡ Fun fact:
------------

The term "bug" to refer to a computer error was first used by Grace Hopper, a pioneer in computer programming. In 1947, she discovered a moth trapped in a computer and taped it to the logbook with the annotation "First actual case of bug being found." This inspired the use of the term "debugging" to refer to the process of finding and fixing errors in computer programs.
